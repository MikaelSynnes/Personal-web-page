        <p>This project was part of the bachelor thesis in computer engineering at NTNU Ã…lesund. The demoapplication was created using Unity3D for
            use with Microsoft Hololens. The purpose for the application was to show interview candidates for the thesis how the possible outcome of an
            Augmented Reality application would look like.
            Pictures below are taking of the demo within unity and from the hololens during demo.
